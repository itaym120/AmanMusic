This is an RTL Open Source music player.

The API and code must be as tidy and readable as possible.

1. make audio AND video playable from a source.
2. build layout that fits all screen sizes.
3. integrate audio/video playing into the layout.
4. search works on any field of file
5. make shuffle work
6. make playlist works (playing + social)
7. append what currently hearing to last activity box
8. make home tab work similar to youtube main page -- suggested + recently played
9. make playlist tab work (playlists should work at #6)
10. being able to 'like' a song and save it.
11. saved tab show what saved.
12. user clickable -- <options>, <log out>
